# üé≠ Talker Bot

This is a Telegram bot that allows users to generate animated face videos using a reference image and a driving video.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- Animates photo based on the movement and speach in the driving video
- Users can keep original driving video's voice or set different voice for the animations 
- Multi-Language Support: Allows users to interact with the bot in their preferred language (currently supports English, German and Russian).
- Allowlist System: Only allows access to the bot for users authorized by admin.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The facial animation technology is powered by [LivePortrait](https://github.com/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait). Voice conversion technology is  powered by [TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS). This bot only wraps that functionality into a user-friendly Telegram interface.

## How It Works üõ†

![demo](./demo.gif)

- [optional] Users call `/set_voice` command to set a certain voice for animations (original, male, female or custom)
- Users upload a photo (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.)
- Bot asks for a driving video
- Users upload a video (`.mp4` or a round video note)
- Bot sends the resulting animation back to the user
